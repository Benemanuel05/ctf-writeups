# TryHackMe â€“ Offensive Security Intro Walkthrough

##  Room Summary
This is the first room in the Cyber Security 101 path on TryHackMe. It introduces the concept of offensive security â€” specifically what penetration testers, red teamers, and ethical hackers do.

### ðŸ’¡ Key Topics Covered:
- What is offensive security
- Key roles in red teaming
- Tools used by pentesters
- The ethical and legal aspects of hacking

---

##  What I Learned:
- **Red team vs blue team:** Red is offense, blue is defense.
- **Ethical hacking is permission-based** â€” always get legal approval.
- Offensive security professionals use tools like:
  - **Nmap** for scanning
  - **Burp Suite** for web testing
  - **Metasploit** for exploitation

##  I Didnâ€™t Take Screenshots for This Room
This was my first TryHackMe room, and I forgot to document it visually. For all future rooms, I will include annotated screenshots of my process.
